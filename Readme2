An elastic supply (or rebase) token works in a way that the
circulating supply expands or contracts due to changes in
token price. This increase or decrease in supply works with a
mechanism called re-basing. When a rebase occurs, the
supply of the token is increased or decreased algorithmically,
based on the current price of each token. In some ways,
elastic supply tokens can be paralleled with stable coins. They
aim to achieve a target price, and these re-base mechanics
facilitate that. However, the key difference is that rebasing
tokens aim to achieve it with a changing (elastic) supply.
FLOKINOMICS differs by having an increasing peg price, an
upcoming. Supply-elastic tokens work differently. As
mentioned, the re-basing mechanism adjusts the token
circulating supply periodically. Letâ€™s say we have an elastic
supply token that aims to achieve a value of 1 USD. If the
price is above 1 USD, the re-base increases the current
supply, reducing the value of each token. Conversely, if the
price is below 1 USD, the re-base will decrease the supply,
making each token worth more.
